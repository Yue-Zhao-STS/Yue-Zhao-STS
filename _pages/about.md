<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


Greetings :) 你好<br />

My name is Yue Zhao (赵玥 in simplified Chinese). I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Science and Technology Studies at Cornell University, working at the intersection of the history of information technology and history of the body in Modern China. Before coming to Cornell, I did my Master's in Media, Culture, and Communication at NYU.<br />

​In my spare time, I enjoy painting, jazz, and sci-fi movies. I also take pictures and make podcasts.<br />
